# montage_simulations

Python and Matlab scripts for simulations of the electric fields caused by the three different montage conditions (A = occipital TACS; B = retinal control stimulation; C = cutaneous control stimulation). The scripts require SimNIBS4 or higher and the SimNIBS example dataset "ernie". They are also supplied directly as part of the examples included in the SimNIBS package. As SimNIBS itself, they are published under the GPL v3 license.
